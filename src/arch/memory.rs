//! Selected-architecture host memory mechanisms.

//! Kernel memory policy owns allocation, mapping lifecycle, and protection
//! policy. This facade exposes stage-1 construction and activation plus the
//! architecture implementations of the HAL address, cache, barrier, and
//! atomic-capability contracts. Their architecture-specific semantics remain
//! visible through those HAL traits rather than a weaker common operation.
//! Unsafe operations are direct selected-backend exports, so their
//! architecture-specific safety preconditions remain part of the callable
//! contract. The aliases introduce no runtime dispatch or wrapper state.

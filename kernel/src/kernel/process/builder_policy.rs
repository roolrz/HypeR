//! Capability-containment policy for staged Native process construction.

use hyper::abi::native;

/// Explicitly reviewed object kinds which may be retained by `ProcessBuilder`.
///
/// `TransferClass` alone is insufficient: a builder is a persistent capability
/// container and can outlive or cross out of the process that configured it.
/// Lifecycle-bearing Process, Thread, and VMAR objects are excluded. A
/// `TaskGroup` is admitted because a delegated process launcher must name the
/// group of every child it creates; staged startup remains an audited,
/// non-buffered transfer route, and Process retirement closes the delegated
/// handle before retiring its membership edge. VM creation authorities are
/// admitted so the initial supervisor can delegate construction to a fleet
/// manager and move a one-shot lease into an isolated VM runtime. Installed
/// VM and vCPU control objects remain excluded. Nested `ProcessBuilder`
/// authority is always forbidden.
